Both at this point are not fully working ( html, css, js version far more advanced)

Known Issues :

- [ ] when adding folders and bookmarks it can visually duplicate
      but a quick page refresh and it all good again.

install for the moment anyway
1. Download and place launchy folder anywhere you wish.
2. Open your browsers setting and find homepage
3. point the browser to the index.html file inside the launchy folder
